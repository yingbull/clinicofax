# Identifying and Addressing PHP 8.4 Incompatibilities in ICTCore

This guide outlines a systematic approach to identify and address PHP incompatibilities within the ICTCore codebase when migrating towards PHP 8.4.

## 1. Consult Official PHP Migration Guides (Crucial First Step)

The official PHP migration guides are the **authoritative source** for understanding changes between PHP versions. It is essential to review these sequentially.

*   **From your current PHP version up to PHP 8.3 (and then 8.4 when its guide is finalized):**
    *   [PHP 7.4 to PHP 8.0](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration80.php)
    *   [PHP 8.0 to PHP 8.1](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration81.php)
    *   [PHP 8.1 to PHP 8.2](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration82.php)
    *   [PHP 8.2 to PHP 8.3](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration83.php)
    *   **PHP 8.3 to PHP 8.4:** (As of the last knowledge update, the detailed migration guide for PHP 8.4 might still be under development or recently released. **Always refer to the latest official PHP 8.4 migration guide on php.net once it is available.**)

*   **What to look for:**
    *   **Backward Incompatible Changes:** These are changes that can break existing code.
    *   **Deprecated Features:** Features that will be removed in future PHP versions. It's best to replace them proactively.
    *   **New Features:** Understanding new features can help you write better, more modern PHP.
    *   **Changed Functionality:** Subtle changes in existing functions.

**Action:** Thoroughly read these guides. Create a checklist of potential issues relevant to ICTCore based on the features and patterns used in the project.

## 2. Using Static Analysis Tools

Static analysis tools can automatically detect many potential issues without executing the code. PHPStan and Psalm are highly recommended.

### Setup and Configuration

*   **Installation (via Composer, typically as dev dependencies):**
    ```bash
    composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan
    composer require --dev vimeo/psalm
    ```

*   **Configuration:**
    *   **PHPStan:** Create a `phpstan.neon` configuration file in your project root.
        ```neon
        parameters:
            phpVersion: 80400 # For PHP 8.4 (e.g., 80100 for 8.1, 80200 for 8.2, etc.)
            level: 5 # Start with a reasonable level (0-9), and increase as you fix issues.
            paths:
                - src/ # Directory/directories to analyze
                - tests/
            # Exclude files or directories if needed
            # excludePaths:
            #     - src/vendor/*
        ```
    *   **Psalm:** Create a `psalm.xml` configuration file. You can generate a basic one using `vendor/bin/psalm --init`. Then, adjust it.
        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <psalm
            errorLevel="1"
            resolveFromConfigFile="true"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xmlns="https://getpsalm.org/schema/config"
            xsi:schemaLocation="https://getpsalm.org/schema/config vendor/vimeo/psalm/config.xsd"
            phpVersion="8.4" <!-- Specify PHP version -->
        >
            <projectFiles>
                <directory name="src" /> <!-- Directory/directories to analyze -->
                <directory name="tests" />
                <ignoreFiles>
                    <directory name="vendor" />
                </ignoreFiles>
            </projectFiles>
        </psalm>
        ```
        You might need to adjust error levels and baselines as you go.

### Running Analysis

*   **PHPStan:**
    ```bash
    vendor/bin/phpstan analyse -c phpstan.neon
    # To specify PHP version directly (less common if phpVersion is in neon):
    # vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --php-version=8.4 src/ tests/
    ```

*   **Psalm:**
    ```bash
    vendor/bin/psalm
    # To set PHP version directly if not in XML (or to override):
    # vendor/bin/psalm --php-version=8.4
    ```
    If you have a large number of initial errors, Psalm can create a baseline file to ignore them temporarily, allowing you to focus on new issues:
    ```bash
    vendor/bin/psalm --set-baseline=psalm-baseline.xml
    vendor/bin/psalm --update-baseline
    ```

### Interpreting Results

*   Static analysis tools will list file paths, line numbers, and the issues found.
*   Prioritize fixing errors related to:
    *   Backward incompatible changes.
    *   Deprecated features.
    *   Type errors, as these are common when migrating PHP versions.
*   Gradually increase the analysis level (e.g., in `phpstan.neon`) as you fix issues.

## 3. Running the Test Suite

ICTCore's existing test suite (unit, integration, functional) is invaluable for identifying behavioral changes and regressions.

*   **Environment:** Ensure your testing environment is configured to use PHP 8.4.
*   **Execution:** Run all tests:
    ```bash
    # Example using PHPUnit (actual command depends on ICTCore's setup)
    # vendor/bin/phpunit
    # or a composer script
    # composer test
    ```
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Failures are good!** They directly point to code that is not behaving as expected under PHP 8.4.
    *   Investigate each test failure. Use the error messages and stack traces to understand the root cause.
    *   Fix the underlying code and re-run the tests until they pass.

## 4. Common Incompatibility Areas and New Features

Here are common areas to watch for, based on changes in PHP 8.0 through 8.3. **Refer to the official PHP 8.4 migration guide for specifics related to 8.4.**

*   **Deprecated Features:**
    *   *Example (pre-PHP 8.1):* `FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING` was deprecated in PHP 8.0 and removed in 8.1. Replace with `htmlspecialchars()` or other appropriate sanitization.
    *   *Example:* Certain uses of `ReflectionParameter::getClass()` returning `false` (use `getType()` and check `ReflectionNamedType` or `ReflectionUnionType`).
    *   Check migration guides for functions, INI directives, or features being phased out.

*   **Stricter Type Checks & Error Handling:**
    *   PHP has become stricter with type declarations and internal function argument types. Code that previously worked with loose types might now throw `TypeError` exceptions.
    *   Some warnings or notices might have been converted to `Error` exceptions (e.g., accessing undefined variables, invalid array keys).
    *   **Action:** Ensure type declarations are accurate. Add explicit type checks or casts where necessary. Handle potential exceptions.

*   **String and Array Function Changes:**
    *   While major breaking changes are rare, subtle differences can occur. For example, functions like `explode()`, `implode()`, `trim()`, `str_contains()` (new in PHP 8.0), `array_key_first()`, `array_key_last()` might have slightly different behavior in edge cases, or new, more specific functions might be available.
    *   **Action:** Review usage of core string and array functions, especially if tests indicate unexpected behavior.

*   **PHP 8.0 Features:**
    *   **Constructor Property Promotion:** Simplifies class definitions.
        ```php
        // Old way
        // class User {
        //   private string $name;
        //   public function __construct(string $name) { $this->name = $name; }
        // }
        // New way
        class User {
          public function __construct(private string $name) {}
        }
        ```
    *   **Named Arguments:** Call functions by specifying parameter names. Improves readability, especially for functions with many optional parameters. Be mindful that renaming parameters in library code becomes a breaking change.
        ```php
        htmlspecialchars($string, ENT_QUOTES | ENT_SUBSTITUTE, 'UTF-8');
        // vs
        htmlspecialchars(string: $string, flags: ENT_QUOTES | ENT_SUBSTITUTE, encoding: 'UTF-8');
        ```
    *   **Match Expression:** A stricter, safer alternative to `switch`. It's an expression, so its result can be assigned.
        ```php
        // Old switch
        // switch ($statusCode) {
        //   case 200: $message = 'OK'; break;
        //   case 404: $message = 'Not Found'; break;
        //   default: $message = 'Error'; break;
        // }
        // New match
        $message = match ($statusCode) {
            200 => 'OK',
            404 => 'Not Found',
            default => 'Error',
        };
        ```
    *   **Nullsafe Operator (`?->`):** Chain method/property access on potentially null objects without explicit null checks.
        ```php
        // Old way
        // $country = null;
        // if ($session !== null) {
        //   $user = $session->user;
        //   if ($user !== null) {
        //     $address = $user->getAddress();
        //     if ($address !== null) {
        //       $country = $address->country;
        //     }
        //   }
        // }
        // New way
        $country = $session?->user?->getAddress()?->country;
        ```
    *   **Union Types (`TypeA|TypeB`):** Declare that a variable, parameter, or return type can be one of several types.

*   **PHP 8.1 Features:**
    *   **Enums:** Define strongly-typed enumerations.
        ```php
        enum Status: string {
            case PENDING = 'pending';
            case COMPLETED = 'completed';
        }
        function setStatus(Status $status) { /* ... */ }
        setStatus(Status::PENDING);
        ```
    *   **Readonly Properties:** Properties that can only be initialized once (in the constructor) and cannot be changed.
        ```php
        class UserData {
            public readonly string $username;
            public function __construct(string $username) {
                $this->username = $username;
            }
        }
        ```
    *   **Intersection Types (`TypeA&TypeB`):** Declare that a value must satisfy multiple interface constraints.
    *   **`final` class constants:** Prevent overriding constants in child classes.
    *   **`never` return type:** Indicates a function that will always `throw` or `exit`.
    *   **Fibers:** Low-level mechanism for cooperative concurrency.

*   **PHP 8.2 Features:**
    *   **Readonly Classes:** All properties in the class become implicitly `readonly`.
    *   **DNF (Disjunctive Normal Form) Types:** Combine Union and Intersection types, e.g., `(TypeA&TypeB)|null`.
    *   **New `Random` Extension:** A more robust and extensible way to generate random numbers.
    *   **Sensitive Parameter Value Redaction (`#[\SensitiveParameter]`):** Prevents sensitive data (e.g., passwords) from appearing in stack traces.
        ```php
        function login(string $username, #[\SensitiveParameter] string $password) { /* ... */ }
        ```
    *   **Constants in Traits.**

*   **PHP 8.3 Features:**
    *   **`json_validate()`:** Efficiently validate a JSON string without decoding it.
    *   **Typed class constants:**
        ```php
        class Config {
            public const string DEFAULT_HOST = 'localhost';
            public const int DEFAULT_PORT = 8080;
        }
        ```
    *   **Dynamic class constant fetch:** `Foo::{$bar}`.
    *   **New `#[\Override]` attribute:** Intention-revealing attribute to mark methods that are intended to override a parent method.

*   **PHP 8.4 Specifics:**
    *   As mentioned, the precise list of deprecations and breaking changes for PHP 8.4 will be in its official migration guide. Common themes in PHP evolution include stricter typing, improved security features, and performance enhancements. **Check the official PHP 8.4 migration guide on php.net.**

## 5. Iterative Approach

Do not try to fix everything at once.

1.  **Configure PHP 8.4:** Set up your local development environment.
2.  **Update `composer.json`:** Set `"php": "^8.4"` (or your target).
3.  **Run `composer update`:** This might fail if dependencies are not yet compatible. Address these first (see `UPDATING_ICTCORE_DEPENDENCIES.md`).
4.  **Run Static Analysis:** Fix a batch of reported issues.
5.  **Run Tests:** Fix any failures.
6.  **Commit:** Save your progress.
7.  **Repeat:** Continue with static analysis and testing, iteratively fixing issues.
8.  **Adopt New Features:** Once compatibility issues are resolved, consider refactoring code to use new PHP features where they improve clarity, performance, or robustness.

## 6. Version Control

*   **Branch:** Create a dedicated branch for the PHP 8.4 upgrade (e.g., `feature/php8.4-upgrade`).
*   **Commit Frequently:** Make small, atomic commits with clear messages. This makes it easier to track changes and revert if something goes wrong.
    *   Example commit messages:
        *   `Fix: Correct type hint for X service for PHP 8.1 compatibility`
        *   `Refactor: Replace deprecated StringUtil::contains with str_contains()`
        *   `Test: Adjust UserTest to account for stricter null checks in PHP 8.2`

By following this comprehensive approach, combining official documentation, automated tools, and thorough testing, you can effectively migrate ICTCore to PHP 8.4 and leverage its new capabilities. Remember to consult the latest official PHP 8.4 documentation as it becomes available.
