# Guide to Updating Documentation After ICTCore PHP 8.4 Migration and ICTFax GUI Updates

This guide outlines the essential steps and considerations for updating all relevant documentation following the migration of ICTCore to PHP 8.4 and any associated updates to the ICTFax Angular GUI. Accurate and up-to-date documentation is critical for developers, users, and operations teams.

## 1. Types of Documentation to Update

Identify and review all existing documentation. The PHP 8.4 migration and potential API changes will likely impact multiple areas.

*   **Developer Documentation:**
    *   **ICTCore Setup Guides:**
        *   **Action:** Update guides (e.g., `PHP_SETUP_GUIDE.md`, `INSTALL.md`, contribution guides) to reflect PHP 8.4 as the required version.
        *   **Details:** List new PHP extensions required for 8.4, changes in OS-level dependencies, and any modifications to environment setup procedures (e.g., virtual host configuration, `php.ini` settings).
    *   **ICTCore & ICTFax Build Process:**
        *   **Action:** If the build process for ICTCore (e.g., Composer commands, build scripts) or ICTFax (e.g., Angular CLI commands, environment configurations) has changed, document these modifications.
    *   **ICTCore API Documentation:**
        *   **Action:** This is critical if API endpoints were added, removed, or their request/response formats, or authentication mechanisms were changed.
        *   **Tools:** If using Swagger/OpenAPI, update the specifications file (`swagger.json`, `openapi.yaml`). Regenerate HTML documentation from these specifications.
        *   **Manual Docs:** If API documentation is maintained manually (e.g., in Markdown files or a wiki), update these sections diligently. Clearly describe changes to each affected endpoint.
    *   **Architectural Documentation:**
        *   **Action:** If the migration involved significant architectural changes or major refactoring (e.g., adopting new design patterns, changes in service interactions), update any documents describing the ICTCore or ICTFax architecture.
        *   **Diagrams:** Update any architectural diagrams if necessary.
    *   **Dependency Update Guides:**
        *   **Action:** Ensure `UPDATING_ICTCORE_DEPENDENCIES.md` reflects the final state of PHP version constraints and any advice on dependency management related to PHP 8.4.
    *   **Incompatibility Guides:**
        *   **Action:** Review and update `PHP_8_4_INCOMPATIBILITY_GUIDE.md` with any new findings or solutions discovered during the migration and testing phases. Ensure it accurately reflects the final code state.

*   **User Documentation (Primarily for ICTFax):**
    *   **User Manuals / Help Guides / FAQs:**
        *   **Action:** If changes in the ICTCore backend (e.g., modified API behavior) resulted in user-visible changes in ICTFax features, functionality, or UI, update these documents.
        *   **Example:** If a process now requires an extra step, or if data is displayed differently, or if a feature behaves in a new way.
    *   **Configuration Guides (User-Facing):**
        *   **Action:** If the migration impacts how users interact with or configure system settings that are exposed through the ICTFax GUI, document these changes.
        *   **Example:** If new settings became available or existing ones were modified/removed.

*   **Deployment Documentation:**
    *   **Deployment Scripts & Manuals (`DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE_ICTCORE_ICTFAX.md`):**
        *   **Action:** Update all deployment scripts, CI/CD pipeline configurations, and manual deployment guides to reflect the new PHP 8.4 environment for ICTCore.
        *   **Details:** Include steps for installing/configuring PHP 8.4 and its extensions, changes in Composer commands (e.g., `composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader`), web server configuration adjustments for PHP 8.4, and any new steps for deploying ICTFax if its build or deployment process changed.
        *   **Rollback Procedures:** Ensure the rollback section of the deployment guide is still accurate for the new versions.

*   **README Files:**
    *   **ICTCore Repository README:**
        *   **Action:** Review and update the main README.md.
        *   **Details:** Ensure PHP version requirements (PHP 8.4) are clearly stated. Update setup instructions, build commands, and links to more detailed documentation.
    *   **ICTFax Repository README:**
        *   **Action:** Review and update the main README.md.
        *   **Details:** Update any build instructions, environment setup details (especially API endpoint configurations if they are mentioned), and links to relevant documentation.

## 2. Specific Information to Include

Across all updated documentation, ensure the following details are consistently and clearly presented:

*   **PHP Version Requirement:** Explicitly state that ICTCore now requires **PHP 8.4.x**.
*   **Dependencies:**
    *   **Backend (ICTCore):** List any new PHP extensions required by PHP 8.4 or by updated dependencies. Note any significant version changes in key libraries (e.g., if a major framework component was updated).
    *   **Frontend (ICTFax):** List any new npm packages or significant version changes if the Angular update process required them.
*   **Deprecated Features:**
    *   Clearly document any features (both in ICTCore API or ICTFax GUI) that were removed or replaced as part of the migration.
    *   If applicable, provide guidance on migrating to new alternatives.
*   **Configuration Changes:**
    *   **ICTCore:** Detail any changes to `.env` files, `php.ini` settings, web server configurations, or other configuration files. Provide examples of new or modified settings.
    *   **ICTFax:** Document changes to Angular environment files (`environment.ts`, `environment.prod.ts`), especially API endpoint URLs or any other build-time configurations.
*   **API Changes (Recap for emphasis):**
    *   For each changed endpoint: old vs. new URL, method, request parameters, request body structure, response codes, and response body structure.

## 3. Version Control for Documentation

Treat documentation with the same rigor as application code.

*   **Commit to Version Control:**
    *   **Action:** All documentation files (Markdown, text files, Swagger/OpenAPI specs, etc.) should be committed to your Git repository in the same way as source code.
    *   **Benefits:** This provides history, allows for branching, and facilitates collaborative review through pull requests.
*   **Wiki/Online Systems:**
    *   **Action:** If using a wiki (e.g., Confluence) or another online documentation platform, ensure it has robust versioning capabilities.
    *   **Tracking:** If direct versioning is weak, establish a process for tracking significant changes (e.g., maintaining a changelog for the documentation itself).

## 4. Audience Consideration

Tailor the content to who will be reading it.

*   **Developers:**
    *   **Language:** Technical, precise, detailed.
    *   **Content:** In-depth setup instructions, API specifications, architectural details, troubleshooting tips.
*   **End-Users (ICTFax):**
    *   **Language:** Clear, simple, task-oriented, non-technical.
    *   **Content:** How-to guides, feature explanations, FAQs, troubleshooting common issues from a user perspective.
*   **Operations/DevOps:**
    *   **Language:** Technical, focused on deployment, configuration, and maintenance.
    *   **Content:** Deployment steps, server requirements, monitoring instructions, backup and rollback procedures.

## 5. Review Process

An extra pair of eyes can catch errors and improve clarity.

*   **Peer Review:**
    *   **Action:** Have someone other than the primary author review all updated documentation.
    *   **Focus Areas:**
        *   **Accuracy:** Is the information technically correct?
        *   **Completeness:** Is anything missing? Are all relevant changes covered?
        *   **Clarity:** Is the language easy to understand for the target audience? Are there any ambiguities?
        *   **Consistency:** Are terms and instructions used consistently across different documents?
*   **Functional Testing (for User Docs):**
    *   **Action:** If possible, have someone follow user documentation step-by-step to perform tasks in ICTFax to ensure the instructions match the actual application behavior.

## 6. Accessibility

Ensure documentation is readily available to those who need it.

*   **Centralized Location:**
    *   **Action:** Store documentation in a well-known, easily accessible location (e.g., a dedicated documentation website, a clearly organized section in the project's wiki, or within the code repository in a `/docs` folder).
*   **Searchability:**
    *   **Action:** If using a documentation platform, ensure it has good search functionality.
*   **Clear Navigation:**
    *   **Action:** Organize documentation logically with a clear table of contents or navigation structure.
*   **Links:**
    *   **Action:** Provide links from relevant places (e.g., link to API docs from the main README).

---

By systematically updating and reviewing documentation, you ensure that all stakeholders have the information they need to develop, use, and maintain ICTCore and ICTFax effectively after the PHP 8.4 migration. This effort is a crucial part of the overall migration project.
